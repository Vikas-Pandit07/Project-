    <h1>White Pine tree</h1>

    <img src="plants/pinetree.png" />
    <p>
      White Pine Tree Plantations White pine can be found growing alongside
      red pine in typical row-by-row trees plantations. Both pines are grown
      principally for pole wood, fence, pole and telephone. The wood is of low
      quality due to the heavy branching that occurs the full length of each
      tree. Each branch forms a knot, a biological imprint that is visible
      when the tree is milled. Older plantation trees are milled for
      dimensional lumber known as “knotty pine” used for furniture and
      flooring.
    </p>
    <h2>pine tree plantation</h2>
    <p>
      It can be several decades before branch-free pine trunks, are ready for
      harvest, which is often beyond the investment tolerance of most funding
      interests. One way to develop more tolerance would be to advance grow
      tall pine tree seedlings before transplant in a plantation. A nursery
      would use proprietary methods and techniques to quickly grow 10 foot
      tall, almost branch-free, white pine tree seedlings in just 5 years. The
      unique propagation technology manipulates 1 to 2 year-old plug seedlings
      to accelerate the terminal stem of the tree. High density plant
      groupings self-prune the branches each year the tree grows. Seedlings
      grow developed root systems within our patented pyramid pots designed
      shape roots naturally. These naturally shaped root systems “take to the
      soil” quickly, dramatically improving transplant survivability. Tall
      white pine tree seedlings also create an “instant tree plantation” that
      shaves at least 10 years off time to harvest, which improves investment
      tolerance with a faster return on investment.
    </p>
    <h2>White Pine Wood Products</h2>
    <p>
      White pine wood is classified as a softwood with a soft to medium wood
      density. Color varies from creamy white to pale straw, with occasional
      contrasting orange/brown streaks. The wood is used extensively for
      interior trim, window sashes, door frames and for intricate carpentry.
      It is also used for millwork, knotty pine paneling, siding and boards
      for boxes, crates, coffins, boats, woodenware, and novelties. It is also
      grown extensively for Christmas Trees.

    <h1>Basswood</h1>
    
    <img src="plants/basswood.png" />
    <p>
      Basswood, commonly referred to as American basswood, is a hardwood tree
      native to eastern North America. It grows as far north as southern
      Ontario and Quebec in Canada down south to as far as Tennessee. It grows
      best in the fertile soils of the Ohio Great Lakes basin. Commercially,
      basswood is considered too soft a wood to be used for lumber or veneers
      and is therefore most often sold as softwood.
    </p>
    <img src="plants/basswoodtree.jpg" />
    <h2>Growing Basswood</h2>
    <p>
      Growing Basswood For Biomass Typically discarded as a commercially
      viable tree species, basswood is ideal for biomass. like poplar, it has
      a quick rotation tree crop. It has a higher BTU rating than plantation
      softwoods such as pine, it features after harvest regeneration from cut
      stumps,, basswood pelletizes quick and easy its large leaves sequester
      twice the carbon of other deciduous hardwoods and 5 times that of
      coniferous softwoods
    </p>
    <h2>Basswood tree plantion</h2>
    <p>
      Basswood Tree Plantations Trees are planted in parallel rows or large
      looping spirals. Treed rows provide convenient access for mechanical
      planters and harvesters, particularly for biomass cropping. Spiraled
      plantations grow thick trunk wood fast, advantageous for lumber and
      pelleting. Fast becoming known as the tree time forget, growing basswood
      in commercial tree plantations is becoming popular with both timber
      investors and tree farmers alike.

    <h1>Apple Tree</h1>
    <img src="plants/apple.png" />
    <p>
      Apple, (Malus domestica), domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family
      (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. Apples are
      predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though apples are also used
      commercially for vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce, and apple butter and
      are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of the global crop also
      is used for cider, wine, and brandy. Fresh apples are eaten raw or
      cooked. There are a variety of ways in which cooked apples are used;
      frequently, they are used as a pastry filling, apple pie being perhaps
      the archetypal American dessert. Especially in Europe, fried apples
      characteristically accompany certain dishes of sausage or pork. Apples
      provide vitamins A and C, are high in carbohydrates, and are an
      excellent source of dietary fibre.
    </p>
    <h2>Apple tree plantation</h2>

    <p>
      Apple orchards with standard 20 to 30 foot spacing produce between
      20,000 and 30,000 apples per acre. Recent high yield plantings of 500
      trees double production per acre. A Crop Circle Apple Orchard can double
      that again to over 100,000 apples per acre. All temperate varieties of
      apples grow well using Crop Circles including Granny Smith, Macintosh,
      Gala, Delicious, Golden Delicious, Nicola and Spartan apples.

    <h1>Cherry Tree</h1>
    <img src="plants/cherry.jpg" />
    <p>
      cherry, any of various trees belonging to the genus Prunus (family
      Rosaceae) and their edible fruits. Commercial production includes sour
      cherries (Prunus cerasus), which are frozen or canned and used in sauces
      and pastries, and sweet cherries (P. avium), which are usually consumed
      fresh and are the principal type preserved in true or imitation
      maraschino liqueur. A number of species are grown as ornamentals for
      their prolific spring flowers, and the dark red wood of some cherry
      species is especially esteemed for the manufacture of fine furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three types of cherries are mainly grown for their fruit: sweet
      cherries, sour cherries, and, grown to a much smaller extent, the dukes,
      which are crosses of sweet and sour cherries. Sweet cherry trees are
      large and rather upright, attaining heights up to 11 metres (36 feet).
      The fruit is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit) that is generally heart-shaped
      to nearly globular, measures about 2 cm (1 inch) in diameter, and varies
      in colour from yellow through red to nearly black. The acid content of
      the sweet cherry is low. The higher acid content of the sour cherry
      produces its characteristic tart flavour. Sour cherry trees are smaller,
      rarely over 5 metres (16 feet) in height. The fruit is round to oblate
      in shape, is generally dark red in colour, and has so much acid that it
      is not appealing for eating fresh. The duke cherries are intermediate in
      both tree and fruit characteristics. The fruits of all vari

    <p>
      A conventional orchard produces on average 80,000 cherries per acre from
      80 trees. High yield growing techniques improve production by 50%. Crop
      Circle Orchards can triple yields. All types of cherry trees benefit
      from this growing system including Bing cherry, the classic eating
      cherry, Rainier cherry, the food industry processing cherry and Van
      cherry; considered the perfect cherry for pies.

    <h1>Plum Tree</h1>
    <img src="plants/plum.jpg" />
    <p>
      plum, any of various trees or shrubs in the genus Prunus (family
      Rosaceae) and their edible fruits. Plums are closely related to peaches
      and cherries and are widely eaten fresh as a dessert fruit, cooked as
      compote or jam, or baked in a variety of pastries. The European plum (P.
      domestica) and the Japanese plum (P. salicina) are grown commercially
      for their fruits, and a number of species, including the purple-leaf
      plum (P. cerasifera), are used as ornamental plants for their attractive
      flowers and leaves
    </p>
    <p>
      Plum varieties that can be dried without resulting in fermentation are
      called prunes. Such plums have firm flesh and contain high levels of
      sugar, qualities that favour their being preserved by drying, which is
      done in dehydrators or under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experimental high density plum orchards have not proven successful, so
      all commercial plum production derives from conventional row orchards,
      which produce approximately 85,000 plums per acre. A Crop Circle Orchard
      easily doubles production to over 180,000 plums per acre. There are 2
      types of plum trees: blue and yellow, both suitable for Crop Circle
      orcharding. Plum varieties that benefit from this innovative propagation
      system include Methley plums, Blue plums, Yellow plums and Italian
      plums, which are typically dried to make prunes.

    <h3>
      A Douglas Fir Tree Is One Of The Best Carbon Sequestration Trees On The
      Planet
    </h3>
    <p>
      One 50 year old Douglas fir tree sequesters 17 pounds of carbon each
      year and 5 acres of Douglas fir trees captures 127 tons a year
      offsetting the carbon footprint of over 1,000 people.
    </p>
    <h3>Douglas Fir Wood</h3>
    <p>
      Douglas fir is regarded as superior structural lumber. Twice as strong
      as spruce and pine, fir wood is used for beams and floor joists in
      residential and commercial buildings. A laminated beam made from this
      tree equals the strength of a glulam, a type of manufactured beam used
      to span open spaces and support the bearing load of a floor, wall or
      roof structure. Douglas fir lumber generally dries without warping
      keeping walls and floors straight and true. Douglas fir wood can be used
      indoors or outdoors as a decorative finish. It covers well (paint or
      stain), is extremely durable and can last for years. The strength comes
      for its tight wood grain, not seen in other types of softwood.

    <h1>Willow trees</h1>
    <img src="plants/willowtree.png"></img>
    <p>
      Willow, shrubs and trees of the genus Salix, family Salicaceae, mostly
      native to north temperate areas and valued for ornament, shade, erosion
      control, and timber. Salicin, source of salicylic acid used in pain
      relievers, is derived from certain willows. All species have alternate,
      usually narrow leaves and catkins, male and female on separate trees;
      the seeds have long, silky hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the largest willows are black (S. nigra), crack, or brittle (S.
      fragilis), and white (S. alba), all reaching 20 metres (65 feet) or
      more; the first named is North American, the other two Eurasian but
      naturalized widely. All are common in lowland situations.
    </p>
    <h2>Reclaim Land Growing Willow Trees</h2>
    <p>
      Willow can be used to reclaim land, especially low, wetlands of little value. it is insatiable appetite for water
      can lower the water table by several feet reclaiming a portion of the land for agriculture. Wide, extensive
      rooting systems stabilizes slopes along washouts, ravines and riverbanks. A stand of willow trees can quickly
      rebuild an ecosystem; often in as little as 5 years. The roots of willow trees pull toxins, including heavy metals
      from both water and soil, which are stored in the wood of the tree.
    </p>
    <h2>Medicinal Willow Wood</h2>
    <p>
      Herbalists use extracts of white willow bark to treat inflammatory conditions such as headaches, muscle aches,
      joint aches and arthritis. Willow bark was an essential part of a tribal medicine mans treatment of indigenous
      people. According to researchers, natural salicin (an active ingredient in aspirin), flavonoid and polyphenol
      chemicals are responsible for these healing properties.

      Peeling the bark from just pruned branches of a willow for timber plantation would put this resource to work. Too
      small for pellet production, utilizing these cuttings for their medicinal properties would create a secondary
      revenue stream from a willow timber investment.

    <p>Interesting Facts About Eucalyptus Trees<br>

      The worlds most widely planted hardwood species growing in the south United States, western Canada, Europe, Africa and Asia.
      Prized globally for excellence in paper and energy production due to relatively short rotation growing cycles.
      Grows faster than most hardwood species of similar wood density.
      Grows on upland landscapes, reducing pressure on environmentally sensitive areas so they are suitable for after fire reforestation projects (vitally important for Australia and other parts of the world ravaged by wildfires).</p>
     <h2>Eucalyptus Tree Plantations</h2>
    <p>
       Eucalyptus trees can be categorized as two types; open branched Eucalyptus (mallet eucalyptus) and closed branched Eucalyptus (marlock eucalyptus). Mallet eucalyptus is grown in plantations around the world. It grows to a height of 70 feet and is branch clear at least halfway up its truck. The Tasmanian Blue gum tree, a mallet eucalyptus, is the most widely planted eucalyptus tree planted commercially for timber and wood. Closed branch marlock eucalyptus is grown as a landscape tree.</p>
    <p>Eucalyptus Oil<br>
      Jojoba oil extracted from the seeds of the jojoba tree is famous for being the best carrier oil for essential eucalyptus. That is because it closely mimicks the natural oil secretions of human skin, making it a great topical agent for massage oil. Emu oil is obtained from the fat of the emu, a bird native to Australia. Emu oil mixed with eucalyptus oil creates powerful topical ointment to relieve joint pain, remove skin blemishes and grow healthy hair and nails. It is the topical treatment of choice for toenail fungus in Australasia.</p>

    <h1>Beeach Tree</h1>
  <img src="plants/beechtree.png">
  <p>Beech (Fagus) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia, and North America. Recent classifications recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera, Engleriana and Fagus. The Engleriana subgenus is found only in East Asia, distinctive for its low branches, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. The better known Fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the most commonly cultivated.</p>

   <p> Beeches are monoecious, bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The fruit of the beech tree, known as beechnuts or mast, is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn. They are small, roughly triangular, and edible, with a bitter, astringent, or mild and nut-like taste.</p>
    
   <p> The European species Fagus sylvatica yields a utility timber that is tough but dimensionally unstable. It is widely used for furniture framing and carcase construction, flooring and engineering purposes, in plywood, and household items like plates, but rarely as a decorative wood. The timber can be used to build chalets, houses, and log cabins.</p>
    
   <p> Beechwood also makes excellent firewood, easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of washed beech wood are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for Budweiser beer. Beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in some German smoked beers. Beech is also used to smoke Westphalian ham, andouille sausage, and some cheeses.</p>

   <h2> Fruitwood Tree Farming</h2>
    <p>The tall spear fruit tree seedlings used to plant orchards can be used to plant a fruitwood timber farm as well. A tall spear is typically a single leader sapling about 6 feet tall and 5 years old. Pear spears can be custom ordered, variety, age and height. Ideally, the older and taller the tree, the quicker the wood timber harvest in the coming years. Tall Fruitwood tree seedlings can be mechanically planted and manually pruned season to season to ensure that each pear tree has a branch free trunk to a height of 30 feet or more. Annual pruning creates a clear-grained, veneer quality sawlog at harvest. Topping trees at 20 feet increases trunk caliper by an average of 10% each year but shortens the marketable sawlog length by 10 feet, which may affect price.
